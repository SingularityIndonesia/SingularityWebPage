Singularity Project is a Multi Microsite Website built in jetpack compose for web.
As for now, this project serves no specific purposes but to reflect my Narcissistic Personality and my for fun project.

The main goal is to make every site a microsite and make it launchable as a normal application within the browser.
As for now, the main focus is to create shell-like mechanism, and the final idea is to make Desktop like interface with window manager.
You can try the desktop by running exec("/application/Desktop/index.html").
